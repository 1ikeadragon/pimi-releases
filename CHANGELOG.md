# Changelog

[Upstream release history and contributor credits](https://github.com/1ikeadragon/pimi/blob/9eb9f9e9fe879845e4c398b066ef03a60ecc74d9/CHANGELOG.md#0153---2026-11-06)

## 0.17.29 - 2026-11-13

- Pimi keeps its data in one SQLite database (`~/.pimi/pimi.db`): agents, automations, heartbeats, Attack runs and findings, audit logs, receipts, sent attachments, projects and workspaces. On first start the old JSON files are imported once and renamed with a `.migrated` suffix; nothing is deleted. Writes are crash-safe and a daily backup is kept.
- Attack mode:
  - History of past runs, and compare two runs to see new, fixed and repeated findings.
  - Fix several findings at once: each gets its own agent in its own worktree, three at a time.
  - A phone view with run status, Pause, Stop and findings.
  - Scheduled runs and runs on new pull requests. Pimi can start your app first and waits for it to be healthy; skipped runs are logged.
- Relay: turn it off from the pairing screen without restarting. Fewer noisy log lines after a relay socket closes.

## 0.17.28 - 2026-11-12

- Windows x64 build is back alongside macOS and Android.
- Attack mode has seven roles: recon, UI QA, API, auth, input, secrets audit and a light performance check. Auth testing needs test credentials, which stay out of run records. Performance checks and writes are allowed only on a target you mark as disposable by typing its host to confirm; every other run stays read-only.

## 0.17.27 - 2026-11-12

- Search across the workspace like VS Code: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F opens the Search view with case, whole-word and regex toggles, include and exclude globs, and replace with a preview. Replace all skips files with unsaved edits and says so.
- Find works in every pane: editor (with replace, Cmd+G, Cmd+D, Cmd+Shift+L, Ctrl+G go to line), terminal, chat, git diffs and the in-app browser.
- New Review screen, opened from the sidebar, chat cards and PR links:
  - A pull request inbox with search and an All / To review filter. Paste a PR URL to open it.
  - Overview: description, a separate Checks card (failed first, with logs), threads and commits.
  - Changes: file tree with thread counts and viewed marks, and the diff with threads inline.
  - Fix this, on a check or thread, prefills a chat in a matching workspace. Nothing is sent or pushed.
  - The old Review page is gone.
- Attack mode:
  - New views: Terminal (each agent's commands, plus live terminals), Browser (live stage and stills), Desktop, Visualize (agent graph and route coverage), and an Audit tab with spend per agent.
  - Desktop target (macOS): pick one app window. Agents see it, and click or type in it only if you allow input. Needs Screen Recording, and Accessibility for input.
  - Findings link to your pre-flight annotations, and agents see the annotation screenshots.
  - Merge duplicate findings yourself, and add budget to resume a spent run.
  - Finding screenshots are more reliable, and an agent waiting for permission no longer counts as stalled.

## 0.17.26 - 2026-11-12

Update every device together: desktop, Android and any other computer running Pimi. A 0.17.25 app cannot talk to a 0.17.26 computer, because the relay handshake was renamed. You do not need to pair again.

- Pimi is no longer called Paseo anywhere. On first start the app stops the old Paseo daemon and moves `~/.paseo` to `~/.pimi`. If the move is interrupted, the next start finishes it. Saved hosts, settings, chats and agents carry over. `PASEO_*` environment variables are now `PIMI_*`, and a repository's `paseo.json` is ignored; rename it to `pimi.json`.
  - Sign-ins inside the in-app browser do not carry over; sign in again.
- Tasks, Spaces, Memory and Review open again. Since 0.17.24 their server failed to start because of a missing image.
- Command palette: Cmd/Ctrl+K searches commands, settings and slash commands. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P opens commands directly; type `>` for commands or `%` for settings. A settings result opens the page with the field highlighted, and Settings has its own search field.
- VS Code-style keys for find, the palette and the editor. Focus mode moved to Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M, and Pin chat to Cmd+Alt+P (Ctrl+Alt+P). The workspace search view is not in this release yet, so Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F does nothing.
- Review drops File tour and Explain changes.
- Saved data is cached in memory and flushed safely to disk, and old receipts and finished Attack runs are pruned.
- Attack: a run that stalls is flagged, and findings stay readable in narrow windows.

## 0.17.25 - 2026-11-12

- Inline Git blame no longer flickers when you move between lines. Hover it for the commit card (author, date, message, SHA). Click it to open that commit's change to the file at the blamed line. Uncommitted lines open the working-tree diff.
- Tool results that mix local and remote images show all of them. A remote image that fails to load shows as unavailable instead of breaking the row.
- Spaces and Memory open without the New note button and empty cards popping in late, and their buttons, search box and empty states match the rest of the app.
- `pimi import` sends the provider fields the daemon expects.
- Relay: the relay server code drops the unused Cloudflare Worker version. The self-hosted relay guide covers running behind the Cloudflare proxy, pairing and sharing one relay, and links in the app and CLI point to it.

## 0.17.24 - 2026-11-12

- New Attack mode, next to Agent and IDE. Point a lead agent and its helpers at an app you built, and they test it for bugs and security issues without asking for approval and without changing anything.
  - Every agent in the run appears as a tile with a live preview. Click a tile to read it at full width.
  - A run bar shows the target, time and token budgets, Pause and Stop.
  - Findings arrive live, sorted by severity, with repro steps and evidence. Triage them, or send one to a Fix it agent.
  - Agents check new findings against existing ones and merge duplicates.
  - Browser tabs are limited to localhost and one host you name. The agents' shell is not sandboxed, and the launch form says so.
- Images from subagents (opencode, Codex, Pi) show in the subagent panel again.
- The working indicator uses the Ask Pimi mascot.
- Self-hosted relay: Pimi's relay can run on your own server (docs/self-hosted-relay.md). The default relay endpoint is relay.stateless.computer:443, and relay stays off until you turn it on.
- Opening a `pimi://pair` link goes straight to the Connect sheet.
- Reconnecting the app no longer reruns every git command for each workspace: about 650 git launches in 5 minutes of reloads drop to about 70. Repeated launches in the network log collapse into one line with a count, and the log size cap is enforced as it is written.

## 0.17.23 - 2026-11-12

- Images from agents appear right in the chat: screenshots they read, images from MCP tools, and generated images. Several images from one tool call form a grid. Clicking one opens a lightbox with previous and next. Images stay after a restart and a reload, and a missing file shows as unavailable.
- Sent messages keep their attachment pills after a reload, a reconnect, and on your other devices.
- The Network tab logs inbound HTTP and WebSocket connections and process launches. Logs are saved to rotating files in the logs folder, kept for 3 days by default. Passwords in URLs and flag values are masked. An Open logs folder action opens them.
- Leaner agent setup: providers that receive every tool schema each turn now get only the core Pimi tools, and the rest load on demand. Shorter delegation and visualization instructions. The visual formats live in the pimi-visualize skill.
- The daemon no longer serves the browser web app and PWA. Use the desktop or Android app.
- The daemon starts even if your config still has the old `features.webUi` key.

## 0.17.22 - 2026-11-12

- Browser Annotate: each pill in the composer shows your note, and clicking it previews the screenshot, the note and the exact text the agent receives. Attaching right after picking an element keeps the screenshot, and the captured parent chain no longer includes Pimi's own selection class.
- Toasts have a close button.
- Go to Definition and Find References see edits to every open file, not only the one you query. Rename checks every file before writing any of them.
- Git blame on very large files stops retrying after a timeout, so moving the cursor no longer restarts it.
- Switching a chat's voice works even when its older history can't be loaded. Very large Claude chats keep loading from the newest turns instead of replaying the whole history.

## 0.17.21 - 2026-11-12

- Large chats open much faster. Claude and Codex chats load from the newest turns and fetch older history as you scroll. A 291 MB Claude chat now opens in about a quarter of a second. Older history no longer drops rows while paging.
- Long tool output shows a short preview and loads in full when you expand it, hover it, or it is part of the newest turn. If loading fails, the row offers Retry.
- The Git panel shows status without waiting for GitHub, and Spaces show a still preview of embeds until you click to play.
- The editor has a right-click menu with Go to Definition, Find References, Rename and Search Codebase. TypeScript and JavaScript use the built-in TypeScript service. Rust, Python, PHP and Go use rust-analyzer, basedpyright or pyright or pylsp, Intelephense or phpactor, and gopls when they are installed. Pimi never downloads a language server. Without one, navigation matches by name and Rename is off.
- A new Settings → Editor page shows which language server Pimi found for each language and lets you point it at your own. The first time you open a file whose language has no server, Pimi says so once and links to the setting.
- Git blame for the current line appears almost instantly and no longer blanks while you move the cursor.
- A new Pimi models settings page, after Providers, picks the provider, model and thinking level Pimi uses for its own work: chat titles, workspace and branch names, commit messages, pull request text, Describe it and Ask Pimi. Each feature can use the default or its own model. If a chosen model can't run, Pimi shows an error instead of quietly using another one.
- While an agent works, the chat shows Pimi and a status line saying what is happening: the tool it is running, Thinking, Writing, or Waiting for your approval. Elapsed time appears after a few seconds.
- The automation editor no longer asks to discard changes. Unsaved edits stay with each automation while you move around the app, with an Unsaved changes bar to save or discard them. Adding a step or check no longer resets the canvas view. On phones the create buttons wrap.
- Review comments use a compact inline box (⌘↵ to submit), and the floating Send feedback button is gone. Sent annotation pills jump back to their source.

## 0.17.20 - 2026-11-12

- Automations open in a full-screen editor built around the step graph, replacing the old dialog. Drag the canvas to pan, scroll or pinch to zoom, and use Fit to recenter. The graph opens centered at a readable size.
- Checks read as a sentence: "Go to Yes when [reply from a step] [starts with] [text]". Pick a preset from Start from, try a sample reply in Try it, and use the new "starts with" and "ends with" tests. A check that compares with empty text can't be saved.
- Describe it drafts in the background. Keep working, and a notification says when the draft is ready to open. A failed draft offers Retry, and a draft still in progress can be dismissed.
- Unsaved edits in the automation editor survive a dropped connection, and leaving with unsaved edits asks first.
- While agents run and the Mac is on AC power, Pimi keeps the display awake.

## 0.17.19 - 2026-11-11

- Automations can run several steps. Connect agent steps and checks into a graph on the automation's canvas. Steps that don't depend on each other run at the same time, and a later step can use an earlier step's output. A failed run shows which step failed, and Retry reruns from that step, keeping the earlier results.
- Describe an automation in plain words and Pimi drafts the steps and schedule for you to review and edit before saving. A drafted automation waits for your approval, as one an agent creates does.
- Automations can start on pull requests: when a PR opens, gets new commits, or has a review requested. Pimi checks with the `gh` CLI, and each new PR commit starts one run.
- Agents and the CLI can edit an automation's steps and retry a failed run.
- Flow diagrams have a new look. Each box has a coloured icon tile for its kind, edges are dashed and move on desktop, and edge labels are small rounded pills. Hover or tap a box to highlight it and its connections.
- Tapping a chart or diagram on a touch screen now selects it.
- The Android app no longer crashes when you open a chat with a flow diagram.

## 0.17.18 - 2026-11-11

- Automations replace schedules. Run an agent on a cron schedule or at an interval, in the provider's unattended mode. A run that hits a permission prompt fails at once instead of hanging. Automations an agent creates wait until you approve them. **Upgrading deletes the old `schedules` folder in your Pimi home, so recreate any schedules you still need as automations.**
- Heartbeats are separate from automations. You can change or delete them from the CLI.
- Agent profiles: save instructions, a provider, a model and a thinking level as a profile, manage profiles on the new Profiles page, and run automations as a profile. The four built-in profiles are rewritten. ACP agents now receive profile instructions.
- Stop a chat and its working subagents stop with it. The chat shows "Stopped with N subagents · Resume", and Resume restarts them where they left off.
- When one agent answers another agent's permission prompt, the chat shows which agent allowed or denied it.
- Open any chat visual in its own tab: charts, flows, sequence diagrams, tables and Mermaid diagrams, as well as HTML visuals. Pan and zoom charts, flows and tables with a drag, the scroll wheel, a pinch, or the −, + and Fit buttons.
- Sequence and state diagrams are drawn natively and wrap long messages on a phone. Sequence diagrams and flow box borders are readable in light and dark themes, and flow arrowheads land on their boxes.
- Charts with log-scale bars, and heatmaps whose transform is written inside their data, now draw. Mermaid gantt charts are wide enough to read and scroll sideways on a phone. Tables, charts and flows fit a phone screen.
- Subagents use one set of status words everywhere, and the sidebar shows only live subagents under their chat.
- Hub is removed.
- Supply chain: release builds check npm signatures and lockfile sources, refuse packages younger than 10 days, and check packages against a malware feed. npm install scripts are off. Several small dependencies are replaced with built-in Node APIs or local helpers.
- Pimi now ships for macOS on Apple silicon and Windows x64 only, plus Android. Linux and Windows arm64 builds are dropped.

## 0.17.17 - 2026-11-11

- Pimi tools are on unless you turn them off, so agents can start Claude, Codex, and other providers as worker cards, use shared memory, and track tasks. When the tools are off, agents say so instead of running other agent CLIs in a shell.
- Ask an agent to use several providers, such as "use codex and claude for this", and it starts one worker per provider. Name a provider alone and the worker uses that provider's default model and mode.
- Workers appear in the sidebar under the chat that started them, with their provider and status.
- HTML visuals opened in a tab use the app theme, as they do in chat.
- A chart or dashboard with a field Pimi does not know still draws, and a dashboard drops only the tile it cannot read. A block that cannot be drawn shows a short note with its data behind Show data.
- Click an annotation in the composer to jump to the quoted text, which pulses so you can find it. Use the pencil to edit the note.
- Ask Pimi and agents can read the text of links saved in Spaces, including the full text of arXiv papers. For a request that needs more than a short answer, Ask Pimi offers to start a chat.

## 0.17.16 - 2026-11-10

- Select text in chat or code in the editor and click once to annotate it. The note opens under your selection: press Enter to save it, or Escape to drop it.
- Hover an annotation chip in the composer to read the quote and note. Click it to edit.
- Agents choose between a sentence, a chart, a dashboard, a diagram, and an HTML visual with a new visualization skill, and put the finding in the chart title.
- Agents in chats check their results against the code or data before they report them, and say what they did not verify.

## 0.17.15 - 2026-11-10

- Switch a chat to another provider from the model picker and stay in the same chat. The new provider continues with the conversation, and the thread marks where the model changed.
- Charts in chat show a crosshair and the values for the point under the pointer. Click a legend entry to hide a series.
- Agents can show dashboards in chat with metrics, sparklines, sortable tables, and progress, and can draw scatter plots and stacked bars.
- HTML visuals run in the chat when you scroll to them, follow the app theme, and fit their content.
- Delegated agents show as one row with a status dot. Click the row to open the agent.

## 0.17.14 - 2026-11-10

- Press Up and Down in the composer to walk through every message you sent in a chat, including multi-line ones.
- Copilot, Cursor, Kimi, Kiro, Trae, and custom ACP agents now learn Pimi's chart format and chat actions.
- Ask Pimi hears quiet speech, keeps what you said when you press Stop early, and shows your words and its reply as message bubbles with a short sound.
- Preview custom HTML visuals inside a chat or open them in a tab.
- After an app update, an idle background daemon moves to the new version by itself. If agents are working, Pimi offers a restart instead of interrupting them.
- Review suggestions and task proposals are labeled in the chat timeline.

## 0.17.13 - 2026-11-10

- Delegate from a chat and open each worker from its provider card. Start a subagent from the chat’s Subagents menu to keep it under that chat.
- Create and edit provider profiles with their own binaries, arguments, environment variables, and harness settings.
- See reported token and cost breakdowns and inspect recent usage over time.
- Inspect values in bar, line, area, pie, and donut charts with a pointer, keyboard, or touch.
- Search text from supported Spaces link previews. Annotation notes open beside the text or code you selected.

## 0.17.12 - 2026-11-10

- Select text in chat or code in the editor and add a note to your next message.
- Restore in-app updates on Apple silicon.

## 0.17.11 - 2026-11-10

- Restore in-app updates on Apple silicon.

## 0.17.10 - 2026-11-10

- Switch providers from chat and pick up where you left off. Unsent handoffs keep their history after a restart.
- Send work to several providers from one chat. Worker cards show each provider and its status. Tasks can use a different model for each worker.
- Bar and line charts follow your theme and animate as data changes. Reduced motion skips the animation.
- Ask Pimi can search Spaces, check unfinished work, and open the view you ask for. Voice history keeps the transcript and result together.
- Add a custom provider and see provider icons more clearly in Usage.

## 0.17.9 - 2026-11-10

- Open the selected project in IDE mode before starting a chat.

## 0.17.8 - 2026-11-09

- Switch projects or add a local folder from the IDE title bar. Explorer, editor tabs, and chat line up in a single row with softer dividers.
- Search worktree code from Command Center and jump straight to the matching line. Agents can search the same local index.
- Review history restores the pull request, selected file, and diff position. Back from Review returns to your IDE without a stop on an unrelated view.

## 0.17.7 - 2026-11-09

- Switch between Agent Mode and IDE Mode from the desktop title bar. Edit files with Explorer and chat beside your code.
- Open a file’s split or unified diff in the editor and see Git blame for the current line.
- Switching modes keeps your tabs, chat drafts, and recent editor undo history. Save pending edits before switching.
- Added two default skills for narrowing a request and verifying the real app flow before shipping.

## 0.17.6 - 2026-11-09

- Review opens to a pull request inbox. Filter by review requests or your own open PRs, then switch between the PR overview and its diff. Worktree review has its own tab.
- Ask Pimi can inspect work and track tasks in the background. Say you want a new chat when you want one to open.
- Pair a phone with Pimi from Settings on the same Wi-Fi.
